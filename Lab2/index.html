# Theory Crash Course

This section provides the essential theory to understand a negotiation process in GENIUS platform. In the next section, API definitions will be provided.  

## Domain: Bids, Issues, Values

A `domain` $D$ specification determines what type of offers that can be made by the agents during negotiation. For instance, agents are to negotiate on what type of laptop to purchase, a domain that describes this negotiation can be:

******************************************************************************
[Figure [domain]: An example domain for laptop negotiation]

A domain contains $n$ issues: 

\begin{equation}
D = \{I^{1}, ..., I^{n}\}
\end{equation}

Each issue $i$ consists of $k$ values:

\begin{equation}

\forall I^{i} \in D\quad I^{i} = \{v_{1}^{i}, v_{2}^{i}, ..., v_{k}^{i} \}_{k = |I^{i}| }
\end{equation}

An offer from an agent $a$ that can be formulated as choices $c$:

\begin{equation}
b_{a} = \{ v^{i}_{j} |\ v^{i}_{j} \in I^{i}, 1 \leq i \leq n \}
\end{equation}


**Example**: With this notation, to define Figure [domain] formally with additional issue $Monitor$:

\begin{equation}
D_{laptop} = (Brand, HardDisk, Monitor) \\ 
I_{Brand} = (Dell, Apple, HP) \\ 
I_{HardDisk} = (256GB, 512GB, 1TB) \\ 
I_{Monitor} = (13, 15, 17) \\ 
\label{domainlaptop}
\end{equation}

The agent $a$ can generate a bid $b$ as:

\begin{equation}
b_{a} = (\textit{Brand: }\text{Dell},\ \textit{HardDisk: }\text{1TB},\ \textit{Monitor: }\text{13}^{"}) 
\end{equation}

## Preference Profiles, Utility Spaces

Following the example of the bid, let's assume that there are only two agents: Agent $a$ and Agent $b$ negotiating about *which laptop to buy*.

1. Agent $a$ makes an offer: $b_{a} = (\textit{Brand: }\text{Dell},\ \textit{HardDisk: }\text{1TB},\ \textit{Monitor: }\text{13}^{"})$
2. When Agent $b$ observes the offer, the question is: how preferable is the bid $b_{a}$ for Agent $b$?

Each agent has their own preferences for each issue. In this example, for instance: 

* Agent $a$ prefers **a more portable laptop with high storage**. 
* Agent $b$'s only requirement is **a larger screen** in a laptop.

We say each agent has a _preference profile_ that represents these preferences. Each participant agent has their own profile. There are many types of different profiles[^oprof], the two we are going to focus are:

* **Additive Utility Space**: The space is additive, when a bid is evaluated, this space can generate a total utility. 
* **Partially Ordered Space[^pop]**: Instead of assigning utility value to bids, this space stores a partial order of values. By partial ordering, the available information about the preferences of an agent is that for some bid $X$ is preferred over bid $Y$ for a subset of the possible bids.

### Additive Utility Space

Formally the utility of a bid is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
U(b_a) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \omega_i \frac{eval(v^{i}_{j})}{max(eval(I_i))}
\end{equation}

!!! warning Sum of all weights is $1.0$.
    Formally it is: $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \omega_i = 1.0$
    

Let's again assume, our agent is working in `Laptop` domain (as defined in Equation $\ref{domainlaptop}$).

[Figure [agentbpref]: Preference Profile of Agent $b$ (instantiated with _AdditiveUtilitySpace_)]

!!! note
    **Practice[^answer1]**: Calculate the utility of $b_{a} = (\textit{Brand: }\text{Dell},\ \textit{HardDisk: }\text{1TB},\ \textit{Monitor: }\text{13}^{"})$ for Agent b. 

### Partially Ordered Space

We expect there will three parameters of such space that will control the generation of bids:

* **comparisons**: a subset of bids that are selected randomly from all possible bids that are assumed to be visible.
* _**errors**: the number of errors in the orders_ 

!!! WARNING
    **errors** parameter is not used for now, assume that it is always zero.

With regards to our previous example, if the comparisons equal to the number of possible bids (in $D_{laptop}$, the number of bids are: $\prod^{k}_{i}|I_i|$, which is $27$), the negotiating agent can observe all the possible bids:


\begin{equation}
B_a^{ordered} = (b_a^{1},b_a^{2},b_a^{3}, ..., b_a^{27})
\end{equation}

B_a is sorted by the utility of the each bid starts, from lowest to highest, can be such as:

\begin{equation}
b_a^{1} < b_a^{6} < b_a^{7} \leq ... \leq b_a^{21}
\end{equation}

The list may include bids with same utilities consecutively. Whenever parameter **comparisons** is set to some value, assume that it is $4$. Four bids will be randomly sampled from $B_a$. Then, the agent can only observe, for instance:

\begin{equation}
randomly\_sample(B_a^{ordered}, 4) = (b_a^{21},b_a^{10},b_a^{4}, b^{5}_a)
\end{equation}

With negotiation sessions that have partially ordered space preference profiels, the negotiating agent needs to reason and predict about the other unknown parts of the space. Also, since the utility of each bid is unknown too, the negotiating agent may need to predict the utilities of the other bids the order alone.

!!! note
    Genius 9.1.2 includes`UncertaintyAgentExample.java`, which demonstrates the API to access this preference profile.

[^oprof]: Genius User Guide also mentions: `ConstraintUtilitySpace` and `NonlinearUtilitySpace`.

[^pop]: It is expected that [ANAC 2019](http://web.tuat.ac.jp/~katfuji/ANAC2018/) (Automated Negotiation Competition) is going to include partially ordered preference profiles. 


# Task 1: The laptop domain and preferences in GENIUS

 At this point, if you are expected to be familiar with the theoritical concepts. To not get confused with the implementation, make sure that you understand the topics above. 

 * For this task, create the same domain as shown in Figure [agentbpref] in GENIUS.

!!! WARNING
    There is already a laptop domain included in GENIUS. Use **lab2_laptop** as the name for the new domain.

![Figure [step1]: Right click to the left bar](pic1.png width="500px")

## Add the preference profiles to the domain

After saving the domain with issues create a preference profile for Agent B and an arbitrary profile for Agent A.

![Figure [step2]: Right click to domain's name](pic2.png width="500px")

### Creating an uncertain preference profiles

You can set the preference profile as uncertain and set _comparisons_ metrics:

![Figure [step3]: Setting uncertain preference profile](pic3.png width="600px")

!!! note
    **Practice:** Why do you think that _maximum number of rankings_ (as shown in purple box in Figure [step3]) is set to 27?

## Double check the created XML

When you create the preference profiles and the domain, have a look at the created XML files. They are by default located at:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~sh
{PROJECT_WORKING_DIRECTORY}/genius{version}/etc/templates/lab2_laptop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! warning If you are having trouble finding this file:
    Set your working directory where the genius.jar is located. Some links for you, if you are confused:
    * [What is a working directory in IDE?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory)
    * [How to change the working directory of Intellij run/debug configurations?](https://youtu.be/ES_bpdRiSNM?t=220) 


Check whether `lab2_laptop_util1.xml` is similar as below:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~xml
<utility_space>
    <objective name="lab2_laptop" index="0" description="" etype="objective" type="objective">
        <issue vtype="discrete" name="Brands" index="1" etype="discrete" type="discrete">

# Task 2: Accessing the preference profile via API

In this task, you are going to programmatically access the preference profiles. First, you are going to make your agent access to an AdditiveUtilitySpace preference profile that you created earlier.

## Subtask 1: AdditiveUtilitySpace Exercise

Before doing this exercise, it is very important to read below.

!!! warning Make sure that **uncertainty** option of the preference profiles in `lab2_laptop` is disabled. 
    Otherwise, you might get `NullPointerException` from GENIUS platform.

!!! warning Do not forget to **compile** your agent after making any changes.
    Otherwise, your agent will not output the preference profile.

!!! warning If you see a tiny window when you run GENIUS:
    Have a look at [this solution](https://superuser.com/a/1207925).

!!! error Make sure that your development environment is ready at this point.
    A brief checklist:
    * Make sure you have these files:
        * **ProjectName/**
            * **genius{version}/**
                * **etc/**
                * **log/**
                * **some other genius files**
                * genius{version}.jar
            * **out/**
                * NameOfYourAgent.class
            * **src/**
                * NameOfYourAgent.java
    * Make sure that your project has these following settings (to change these `File`->`Project Structure`->`Project Settings`):
        * Project language level is set to **8**.
        * Project SDK is set to **Java 1.8**.
        * `genius{version}.jar` is included in Libraries tab.
    * Make sure that working directory of run configuration of `genius{version}.jar` is set to `../genius{version}/` folder. 
        * You can again have a look [at the video]((https://youtu.be/ES_bpdRiSNM?t=220) from the previous lab.

 * Copy paste the code snippet **inside** `init(NegotiationInfo info)` method of your agent (**after super.init(info)**): 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~java
AbstractUtilitySpace utilitySpace = info.getUtilitySpace();
AdditiveUtilitySpace additiveUtilitySpace = (AdditiveUtilitySpace) utilitySpace;

List< Issue > issues = additiveUtilitySpace.getDomain().getIssues();

for (Issue issue : issues) {
    int issueNumber = issue.getNumber();
    System.out.println(">> " + issue.getName() + " weight: " + additiveUtilitySpace.getWeight(issueNumber));

    // Assuming that issues are discrete only
    IssueDiscrete issueDiscrete = (IssueDiscrete) issue;
    EvaluatorDiscrete evaluatorDiscrete = (EvaluatorDiscrete) additiveUtilitySpace.getEvaluator(issueNumber);

    for (ValueDiscrete valueDiscrete : issueDiscrete.getValues()) {
        System.out.println(valueDiscrete.getValue());
        System.out.println("Evaluation(getValue): " + evaluatorDiscrete.getValue(valueDiscrete));
        try {
            System.out.println("Evaluation(getEvaluation): " + evaluatorDiscrete.getEvaluation(valueDiscrete));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Run a single negotiation session and validate if your agent can access the preference profile or not.

!!! note Try to understand what each line is doing. Add comments to the code above.
    Have a look at the [GENIUS javadoc](https://tdgunes.com/genius-9.1.1-javadoc/index.html).

## Subtask 2: Partially Ordered Space Exercise

This time, in this space only the preference order of some bids are observed. To access the ranking list of these bids, we use [`userModel field`](https://tdgunes.com/genius-9.1.1-javadoc/genius/core/uncertainty/UserModel.html) of [`AbstractNegotiationParty class`](https://tdgunes.com/genius-9.1.1-javadoc/genius/core/parties/AbstractNegotiationParty.html):

!!! warning Make sure that **uncertainty** option of the preference profiles in `lab2_laptop` is now enabled. 
    Otherwise, you might get `NullPointerException` from GENIUS platform.

!!! warning Make sure that you remove/comment the code that you inserted from the previous task.
    Otherwise, you are going to get some errors, because the API to access the partially ordered space is different in GENIUS.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~java
List< Bid > bids = userModel.getBidRanking().getBidOrder();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also try to access the properties of a bid, using [`Bid class`](https://tdgunes.com/genius-9.1.1-javadoc/genius/core/Bid.html):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~java
List< Issue > issuesList = bid.getIssues();

for (Issue issue : issuesList) {
    System.out.println(issue.getName() + ": " + bid.getValue(issue.getNumber()));
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
* Run a single negotiation session with partially ordered spaces for laptop domain that you created earlier and check if you can access them by using the code snippets from this section.
