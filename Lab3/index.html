This lab introduces the protocols in automated negotiation. The protocols determine the overall order of actions during a negotiation. Parties need to stick to this protocol as deviations from the protocol are caught and penalized.

# Theory Crash Course

This section provides the essential theory to understand how agents communicate with each other to handle negotiations. First some definitions:

* **Bilateral**: Only two agents are participating in the negotiation session.
* **Multilateral**:  Usually refers to more than two agents participating in the negotiation session.

The examples we give on the protocols that defined below are going to be in multilateral settings. However, bilateral settings are also possible with these protocols.

## Protocols without a Mediator

The protocols that are mentioned in this section, does not have a third-party agent that handles communication between negotiatiors.

### **[SAOP: Stacked Alternating Offers Protocol](https://tdgunes.com/genius-9.1.1-javadoc/genius/core/protocol/StackedAlternatingOffersProtocol.html)**

According to this protocol [#Aydoğan2017], all of the participants around the table get a turn per round; turns are taken clock-wise around the table. The first party starts the negotiation with an offer that is observed by all others immediately. Whenever an offer is made the next party in line can take the following actions:

1. Make a counter offer (_thus rejecting and overriding the previous offer_)
2. Accept the offer
3. Walk away (e.g. _ending the negotiation without any agreement_)

!!! note
    This process is repeated in a turn taking clock-wise fashion until reaching an agreement or reaching the deadline. To reach an agreement, all parties should accept the offer. If at the deadline no agreement has been reached, the negotiation fails.

To illustrate:

**Round 1**: 

************************************************
*Agent A                               Agent B *
*    │    ┌─────────────────────────┐          *
*    │    │                         │          *
*    │    │  ┌────────────────────┐ │          *
*    └────┼─▶│  Dell, 256GB, 13"  │ │          *
*         │  └────────────────────┘ │          *
*         │                         │          *
*         └─────────────────────────┘          *
*                                              *
*                   Agent C                    *
************************************************
[Figure [firstrounds1]: _Agent A_ makes an offer]


The second party can *accept this offer*, *make a counter offer* or *walk away*. Let's assume that Agent B makes a counter-offer.

************************************************
*Agent A                               Agent B *
*         ┌─────────────────────────┐      │   *
*         │ ┌────────────────────┐  │      │   *
*         │ │┌───────────────────┴┐ │      │   *
*         │ └┤   HP, 256GB, 17"   │◀┼──────┘   *
*         │  └────────────────────┘ │          *
*         │                         │          *
*         └─────────────────────────┘          *
*                                              *
*                   Agent C                    *
************************************************
[Figure [firstrounds2]: _Agent B_ makes a counter offer]


Assume that Agent A and Agent B accept the offer on the negotiation table. Since they all agree on this offer, the negotiation ends with this offer.

************************************************
*Agent A                               Agent B *
*  ─┐ ┌───────┬─────────────────────┐      │   *
*   └▶│Accept!├──────────────────┐  │      │   *
*     └───┬─┬┬┴──────────────────┴┐ │      │   *
*         │ └┤   HP, 256GB, 17"   │◀┼──────┘   *

*         │                  ┌▶│Accept!│       *
*         └──────────────────┼─┴───────┘       *
*                            │                 *

This protocol is used in the international negotiation competition multiple times. For more about this, check [GENIUS's User Guide Section 2.1](https://tracinsy.ewi.tudelft.nl/pub/svn/Genius/doc/userguide.pdf), [ExampleAgent Wiki](https://github.com/tdgunes/ExampleAgent/wiki/Stacked-Alternating-Offers-Protocol) and [a question from previous year](https://github.com/tdgunes/ExampleAgent/issues/6).

The next protocols are good to know, but our main focus will be on SAOP.

### [Alternating Multiple Offers Protocol](https://tdgunes.com/genius-9.1.1-javadoc/genius/core/protocol/AlternatingMultipleOffersProtocol.html)

There are two phases that consecutively happen in negotiation sessions with this protocol:

* **Bidding Phase** *(every even round (round 0, round 2, ...))*: Each agent submits a bid to the table (i.e. negotiation system).
* **Voting Phase:** *(every odd round (round 1, round 3, ...))* Each agent observes every bid from every agent. Each bid is voted by each agent. Their vote can be accept or reject. 

Before bidding phase starts again, if a bid gets accept votes from all parties, the negotiation ends with this bid. 

### [Alternating Majority Consensus Protocol](https://tdgunes.com/genius-9.1.1-javadoc/genius/core/protocol/AlternatingMajorityConsensusProtocol.html)

This protocol is essentialy same as _Alternating Multiple Offers Protocol_, the main difference is that the protocol keeps track of **the acceptance of offers**. At the end of an negotiation, the most favorable but not accepted by everybody offer is accepted by all parties. If any offer is accepted before the deadline by everybody, the negotiation ends.

!!! note:
    **For example**, assume that negotiation ends because of the deadline and $(Dell, 256GB, 13")$ is offered and accepted by the majority then other offers, then everybody accepts this offer, because of the protocol.

## Protocols with a Mediator:

The protocols that are mentioned in this section, have a third-party agent that handles communication between negotiatiors. This _mediator_ agent hears all of the bids from all parties and the mediator determines which bid to be voted by others. Mediators determines an outcome by observing the votes.

### [Simple Mediator Based Protocol](https://tdgunes.com/genius-9.1.1-javadoc/genius/core/protocol/SimpleMediatorBasedProtocol.html)

In this protocol:

* The mediator creates a bid in each round.
* Other negotiating parties, either accept or reject as before. But they can not provide a counter-offer. 
* The mediator informs all parties about the outcome of the round.

This continues until the deadline is reached or a bid from mediator agent is accepted by every negotiating agent.  

There are several implemented mediators in GENIUS:

* `RandomFlippingMediator`: generates random bids by flipping one issue of the current offer. 
* `FixedOrderFlippingMediator`: same as `RandomFlippingMediator` with a fixed-seed random generator.

### Mediator Feedback Based Protocol

This protocol extends _Simple Mediator Based Protocol_ by changing votes to feedbacks. Instead of negotiating agents provide a binary vote (i.e. [Reject, Accept]), with this protocol they can provide a feedback (i.e. ['better', 'worse', 'same']) to the mediator. 

The mediator generates a different bid in each round as same as before, trying to generate towards to some optimum. The accepted bid is considered as the one that did not get a 'worse' vote from parties.

# Other Factors

Negotiation sessions are parametrized with two additional parameters: _time pressure_, _discount factor_ and _reservation value_. These influence the agents performance throughout the negotiation.

## Reservation Value

`Reservation Value` is the utility of _walking away_. In other words, it is a real-valued threshold that a rational negotiating agent should not accept any offers below that threshold.

!!! note
    Each agent may have a different reservation value.

## Time Pressure

Each negotiation session has a predefined deadline, it can be in real time as _seconds_ or _rounds_. The simulation environment GENIUS normalizes the time $t$ such that $t \in [0,1]$. 

### Discount Factor
Apart from a deadline, a negotiation session may also feature a **discount factor** $d$, which decreases the utility of the bids under negotiation as time passes. It is bounded in range $d \in [0, 1]$. Utility of a bid at the normalized time $t$ from an agent $U_d^t(b_a)$ is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
U_d^t(b_a) = U(b_a) \cdot d^{t} 
\end{equation}

where $U(b_a)$ is the utility of the bid without the influence of the discount factor.

!!! note
    **Practice**: What will happen if $d = 1$? If $d$ is very small or very high, what will be the affect on the negotiation?

!!! warning
    Time pressure has little meaning if the profile is not defined in terms of utilities, e.g. partially ordered preference profiles.


!!! warning
    Reservation values also gets discounted in the same way. 

# Task 1: Implement a simple agent for SOAP protocol

## Subtask 1: Half Best & Half Random
Try to write an agent that gives best offer for itself for half of the time during the negotiation, the agent should give random offers.

Use the snippet from below as a starting point.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~java
import java.util.List;

import genius.core.AgentID;
import genius.core.Bid;
import genius.core.actions.Accept;
import genius.core.actions.Action;
import genius.core.actions.Offer;
import genius.core.parties.AbstractNegotiationParty;
import genius.core.parties.NegotiationInfo;

public class YourAgentsName extends AbstractNegotiationParty {
    private final String description = "YourAgentsName";

    @Override
    public void init(NegotiationInfo info) {
        super.init(info);

    }

    @Override
    public Action chooseAction(List< Class< ? extends Action > > list) {
        
    }

    @Override
    public void receiveMessage(AgentID sender, Action act) {
        super.receiveMessage(sender, act);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Getting the best bid: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~java


private Bid getMaxUtilityBid() {
    try {
        return this.utilitySpace.getMaxUtilityBid();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return null;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating random bids:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~java
Bid randomBid = this.generateRandomBid();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Accessing normalized time $t \in [0, 1]$:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~java
double time = this.getTimeLine().getTime();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Bonus Subtask: Count the counter-offers and accept messages

Try to count the acceptance and counter-offers from which agents. You may think about storing them in a `Map`. 

# Task 2: Print other factors

Try to print discount factor and discounted reservation values in each turn, when your agent is making an action. 

Accessing discount factor $d$ and reservation value $r$:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~java
System.out.println("Discount Factor is " + getUtilitySpace().getDiscountFactor());
System.out.println("Reservation Value is " + getUtilitySpace().getReservationValueUndiscounted());
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
