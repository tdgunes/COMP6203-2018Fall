Over the next two labs you will implement a simple agent.

# Opponent Modelling

A typical approach is to first model the utility of the opponent, based on  the bids received. 

We will use a simple approach based on the Johny Black agent: https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp6203/papers/JohnnyBlack.pdf

(the full proceedsings are  available here: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-51563-2.pdf )

Read section 2.3 of the paper and try to understand how they implement the opponent model. The steps are as follows:

* Start from the example agent (i.e. a working agent which generates random offers). For now assume you know your own preferences.

* First, create a double integer array which keeps track of the frequency of the issue values. 
That is, for each issue, and each value you want to count how many times you received an offer with that value (see Tables 1 and 2 as examples). Make sure this works 
for any number of issues and values (the table can get pretty large when the domain gets larger, so to cope with really large domains you have to be a bit
more clever about this; but for now just use a "naive" approach). 

To do this you need to access information about the domain (how many issues, how many discrete values for each issue). 
An example of how this is done is here: https://github.com/tdgunes/ExampleAgent/wiki/Accessing-the-evaluation-of-a-value 
(note that you don't need the evaluation of a value at this point, but this is an example how to access the information of the domain)

* Now start populating the frequency table. That is, for each incoming bid, update the frequency table. 
To find out more about how the Bid object work, check the Javadoc, i.e. https://tdgunes.com/genius-9.1.1-javadoc/genius/core/Bid.html

Note that you need to match the value to what you have in your table. There are various ways to do this, and requires some basic programming skills and understanding of Java.

Check that your approach works by running the agent and displaying the output.

* Now that you have the table, use the approach from the paper to compute the estimated opponent utility. 
Again check that it works. Initially, with no information, each of the opponent bids should have equal utility. As you receive more bids from your opponent, the utility estimation should gradually improve.

# Concession Strategy

* Start with a concession strategy which sets the target utility level. You can use a simple linear approach, which starts with the highest possible utility, and then concedes up to a threshold when the time limit is reached. Set this threshold using a variable (e.g. it can be the average between the highest and lowest possible utility). If you want to use a slightly more advanced approach, use a Boulware or Conceder strategy (see slides on negotiation lecture and/or literature). 

* Get the set of all bids which have equal or more utility than the target utility.

* Check which one of these bids has the highest opponent utility based on your estimated opponent utility.

Note that, if the estimated utility were to be exact, such a bid would always be Pareto efficient. Explain why this is.

* Offer that bid to your opponent.

# Bonus Task: Nash Bargaining Solution

Instead of using an arbitrary minimal threshold, calculate the Nash bargaining solution offer using the estimated opponent utility, and set the minimum threshold to the utility you have at the Nash bargaining solution point. Make sure you update this information, as you update the estimate of the opponent (i.e. as you receive new offers). 

# Uncertainty 

Check out Section 7.3 of the user guide:

https://tracinsy.ewi.tudelft.nl/pubtrac/Genius/export/103/doc/userguide.pdf

Now create a domain with uncertain preferences, and use the built-in function estimateUtilityFunction for your agent. 

Now you have a complete agent which works with uncertain preferences, and you can try and improve each of the components.

# Evaluation

Evaluate your agent against several other agents. You may want to do this for the complete information case since there are few built-in agents for the incomplete preference setting.
